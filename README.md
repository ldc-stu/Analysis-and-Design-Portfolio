# Analysis-and-Design-Portfolio

-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Personally, learning theory has always been a hassle for me and along with mathematical logic or even the tricky wording in drawn out explanations for a concept, which seems to be common among programmers. After all, in a field where focus in the arithmetic and computer logic is principle it is no suprise that clarifying in layman's terms is not a priority.

-How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

As someone who is more inclined with visual learning it helped in picturing the memory in data structures as "lists" and bearing in mind the layout it takes when things like insertion, searching, or removing data is implemented since a pattern in the code can always be found and examined. Data structures stores these "lists" as organized sets that is used to uncomplicate processes. 

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Roadblocks are usually snuffed out with revisiting zybooks or topics that seem similar to a particular problem in stack overflow forums but as I said earlier communities of programmers struggle in wording layman's terms. Of course they're exceptions but googling compile errors is the usual brute force tactic when there's a hurdle in the way.

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Through out the course it is apparent that readablity, continuity and constant revising is crucial in this area of computer science. The importance of the organization in data with streamlining functionaltiy along with performance became more of a focus for me and new perspectives in collaboarting with a group.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Earlier, I mentioned in clarifying functions in order for effiency to take place but overcomplicating in general is a huge lesson learned since you not only jeopardize your programs adaptability, confusing any collaborators along the way, but also slow performance down with unneeded bloat, poor communication with clients, poor reusablity and even costs. I guess you can say that my approach has become less selfish. It is far simpler picking out clothes that are catalouged in a closet rather than thrown together in a pile.
